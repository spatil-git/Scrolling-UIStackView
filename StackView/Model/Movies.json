{
    "name":"Jumanji: The Next Level",
    "review":"Still fun, but what happened to the game being broken? Jumanji: The Next Level excels with a star-filled and diverse cast with a complexity of approaches to their characters. Dwayne Johnson's ability to portray this was fantastic.",

    "name":"Knives Out",
    "review":"I LOVED it. An amazing cast of characters led flawlessly by Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. The moment I thought I knew what was happening, a twist threw me. One of my year's favorite films.",
